This is a Test Repository
Break IT was founded in 2016 with a very specific vision - to provide the scalability of Software Testing as a Service (TaaS) to businesses willing to consider an 'as and when needed'approach to their testing needs. 

The digital marketplace has always looked at how best to balance time, cost and quality, but the reality is the peaks and troughs in project activities often eat into already tight budgets, especially where traditional resourcing models operate. Part of the inevitable evolution is an emerging need for a flexible service provider with whom forward thinking businesses can develop a strong and long lasting relationship by opting for a scalable testing service, not a costly bum on a seat.

TaaS challenges traditional resourcing models and offers both project teams and freelance developers the opportunity to reshape their testing needs based on real time demand, building valuable product knowledge that can be tapped into through the continued support of a trusted, flexible testing partner. 

Get in touch today and find out how a more flexible approach to your testing needs can benefit your project and your budget.
